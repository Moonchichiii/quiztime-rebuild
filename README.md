## Project Description
---
I wanted to create a very clean and quick quiz, focusing more on the questions and user experience, rather than cluttering it up too much. I will definitely play around, add more features, and change the layout of this project in the future.

## How to Play
---
Playing is incredibly straightforward. Simply click on the answer you believe is correct and try to score as many points as possible. 
Your final score will be displayed at the end, along with an option to retake the quiz.

## Features 
---
Features a simple sign-in that displays your username with a small welcome message in the header of the quiz page, as well as at the end where your score is presented. During the game, your local time is displayed in the right-hand corner of the header. Social media icons are already included in the footer. In the future, I plan to add a countdown function and enhance the user experience with more small features. There is a lot more that will be added along the way, given more time.
